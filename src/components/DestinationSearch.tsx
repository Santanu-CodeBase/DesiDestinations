The file appears to be missing several closing brackets and has some misplaced elements. Here's the corrected version with proper closing brackets and structure:

[Previous code remains the same until the travel recommendations section]

```javascript
                </div>
              </div>
            </div>
          </div>
        )}
      </div>
    </div>
  );
};

export default DestinationSearch;
```

The main fixes made were:

1. Properly closed the nested divs in the travel recommendations section
2. Added missing closing brackets for the main component structure
3. Properly aligned the closing tags for the return statement and component definition

The component structure is now properly nested and all brackets are matched. The functionality should remain the same while fixing the syntax errors.
